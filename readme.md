## Contributing

Thank you for contributing to this repository.

Here are the guidelines:

1. run `gulp --production` at the end if you changed any HTML, Less or JS. Do not send Pull Requests without running this command (unless you haven't touched the frontend)
2. delete `.map` files `rm public/css/app.css.map public/css/vendor.css.map public/js/app.map public/js/vendor.js.map`
3. If you are adding/modifying backend functionality, make sure to include the apprioriate `test`. Let me know if you need help writing the test
